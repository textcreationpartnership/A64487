            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN the truth of our profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, there be four things which oblige us mainly to maintain a Religious Correſpondency with our Brethren of the ſame profeſſion in forraign parts.</p>

                  <item>1. Firſt the Subſtantials wherein the truth of the Profeſſion doth conſiſt.</item>

                  <item>3. Thirdly the Means by which we may attain to theſe ends.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The truth of our profeſſion doth conſiſt in the ſoundneſs of the Doctrine of Faith, and in the holineſs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42327:2"/>
of the life of the profeſſors, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1, 3, 8, 9. to advance and maintain both theſe towards one another, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men: the profeſſors of Chriſtianity are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the ſpeciall commandment of God concerning the communion of Saints, which conſiſts not onely in the conjunction of Beleevers, to ſtrive together for the Faith of the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. but alſo in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all endeavour by prayers to ſtrive one for another, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. and in the communication of their gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to provoke one another unto love, and to good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. Now theſe endeavours cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be put forth by us, except <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome Religious Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency for the maintaining of Truth and Holineſſe be intended and upheld amongſt Proteſtants, therefore ſuch a Correſpondency is abſolutely neceſſary to be minded by us; and if we mind it not, it is evident that we come ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a fundamentall duty, and fall under the guilt of breaking the Communion of Saints; of neglecting the fight for the faith, and of careleſneſſe to provoke others unto love and good works, which God will certainly require at our hands, if we continue to do ſo, having ſo great cauſe and ſo much opportunity to do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>2. The End for which God doth give the gifts and graces of his Spirt unto the Saints; is, that the members of the body of Chriſt ſhould profit thereby one towards another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they ſhould trade there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to gain more graces for themſelves, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 12. 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 14. but it is no more poſſible to do this without maintaining an intercourſe of ſpiritual Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency one with another, then it is poſſible to the diſ joynted member of a natural body, to conveigh blood and nouriſhment each to other. Therefore a courſe of religious Correſpondency is abſolutely neceſſary for this cauſe alſo: and if this be not intended, Gods aime in giving his gifts unto his Saints and Churches is not fulfilled, and he will certainly deprive ſuch of the gifts which they have received, who continue under the guilt of not making a right uſe thereof. For if the end of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42327:2"/>
Gods giving ſhould be anſwered by our receiving, then we are bound in conſcience to receive grace onely for the advancement of his glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. and of our mutual edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. and 15. 2. and if theſe two Ends are ſo ſubordinate one to another, that God cannot be glorified otherwiſe by us, then by this, that we bring forth much fruit one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 6 (for our good cannot reach to him as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent ones in whom ought to be all our delight <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 3.) then it will follow that the main uſe of all grace, is the improvement thereof towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But it is not poſſible to intend this improvement of our goodneſſe towards the Saints for mutuall edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, except we uſe means to know one anothers ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall condition by ſome courſe of ſpirituall Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency; therefore ſuch a Correſpondency is wholly neceſſary to be ſetled and entertained, if we will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive God of his glory, and the Saints of the intereſt which they ſhould have in us by the right uſe of our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents towards them.</p>
               <p>3. The Means by which theſe Ends are to be attained, is to endeavour to keep the Unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, which we are commanded, and by many reaſons exhorted to do, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. Now this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour being the effect immediately flowing from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which is the chief edifying grace as appeareth by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. &amp; chap. 3. <hi>p. totun.</hi> &amp; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 15, 16. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charity cannot be maintained, nor edification ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, nor the unity of the Spirit upheld, except there be an eddeavour put forth to take notice of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtate; therefore a Correſpondency for mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence in ſpirituall matters tending to unity and peace in the profeſſion of the Truth, is a thing abſolutely neceſſary amongſt ſuch as intend ſincerely to uphold the Truth of the Goſpel-profeſſion; or if they intend it not, it is evident that they come ſhort of the fundamentall duty of the life of Chriſtianity, by neglecting the means
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42327:3"/>
of mutual edification wherein God is chiefly glorified; and ſuch as continue in this neglect, and order not their way aright in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, ſhall never ſee the ſalvation of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23.</p>

               <p>THe preſent condition of the Churches comes under a two-fold Conſideration, the one is in reſpect of themſelves, the other is in reſpect of their common Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</p>
               <p>The Churches conſidered within themſelves, are found to be in their particular relations, not onely for the moſt part at a diſtance, and ſtrangers to each others affairs; but many of them are even at open defiance and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to one anothers welfare, which is the more to be blamed and lamented not onely becauſe this behaviour is directly oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Furthermore it is no ſmall wonder unto me, that they having the Oracles of God, and there in two Rules of ſcriptural Interpreration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Analyſis of the Text, and the Analogy of Faith; that the ſcholaſticall way of handling Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical debates ſhould be ſo much in uſe, and that in the debates about the depth of ſecret and unfear hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries (which all ſides confeſſe to be ſuch) there ſhould be ſo much Animoſity. And laſtly, that where the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42327:3"/>
is agreed unto, and in the outſide of the profeſſion onely, there is ſome difference about prudential and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial matters of Order, Diſcipline, &amp; Government, there ſhould be ſo little condiſcention and mutual forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made uſe of, notwithſtanding all the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precepts and duties of Chriſtian charity, and long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for mutual edification. Now that from this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of diviſion, and he great want of moderation and diſcretion, in managing the ſame, ſcandals and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences ſhould infinitely be multiplyed amongſt the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is no wonder at all; for how can it be otherwiſe, when all charitable thoughts are laid aſide, and no bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of compaſſion by reaſon of humane frailties entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that all manner of provocations to offences will on all hands be both given and taken; whence prejudices will continually be more and more heightned, and the Spirit of ſtrife wil (as we ſee it doth) carry on the parties to embrace in their oppoſite courſes, wordly intereſts of a contrary nature, that they may croſs each others advantages: by which means the world takes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible poſſeſſion of the hearts of Profeſſors, which makes them for the moſt part mind more the formality of their partial way, then the ſimplicity of the Goſpel and the power of Godlineſs: ſo that the life of the ſpirit (though much pretended unto by ſome, and not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to others) cannot break through to work any ſenſible effects of holineſſe and ſpiritual edification; but all the means thereof, and the wayes of holy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being either neglected or obſtructed, and the prophane world obſerving our miſcarriages, the way of Truth and Holineſſe is evill ſpoken of by them, and the name of God is blaſphemed for our ſakes.</p>
               <p>Now to Remedy theſe evils, and to draw the Churches to ſome principle or degree of ſpiritual unity, that the wrath of God may be prevented (which may juſtly ſuffer us to devour one another, till we be conſumed one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or the Candleſtick removed from us all) let us mind but one Apoſtolical Rule to be put in practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42327:4"/>
us, whereof the equity is altogether undeniable; and there may be yet ſome hope of our pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervation in ſtore. This Rule is given to the <hi>Philippians</hi> to heal the breach which was between the Jews &amp; Gentile Believers<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15. 16</note> about the matter of Circumcilion, and it is this: <hi>If ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe whereto we have attained already, let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</hi> If then we could be ſo happy, as to be able to perſwade the Churches to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this part of the Rule, one towards another: firſt, mainly to bear each with others imperfection in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, till God reveal further his Truth; and then if in the mean time they would own one another in that whereunto they have already attained; and therein walk by one Rule, and mind the ſame thing: that is, intend that good towards others, which they would have others intend towards them; the miſchief which through the neglect of this duty is like to enſue might be prevented; but how to make the Churches ſenſible of the neceſſity of obſerving this Rule and Precept, is ſcarce imaginable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome Godly party would profeſſedly own this as a duty towards them all in common, and undertake to provoke them by ſome religious way of Correſpondency to a reciprocall practiſe thereof. Therefore again ſuch a Correſpondence is abſolutely neceſſary for the Churches upon this Conſideration, namely to preſerve them from the forenamed evils of their home-bred diſtempers, and from the wrath which undoubtedly will follow thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they continue therein.</p>
               <p>But if the Churches be look't upon with reſpect unto their common Adverſaries, the Papiſts on the one hand, and the Prophane, the Hypocrites, and the Atheiſts on the other; all which enemies lay the Churches waſt ſeverall waies, and undermine their Settlement: this religious Correſpondency to maintain the unity of the Spirit in that whereunto they have attained, will yet appear more abſolutely neceſſary. For it is without all contradiction evident, that nothing doth ſo much advance the wiſhes of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42327:4"/>
Papiſts, and the plots of Atheiſtical States-men againſt the profeſſion of the truth, as our Diviſions amongſt our ſelves. And theſe Adverſaries chiefly the Papiſts make it a great part of their work, by ſubtile Emiſſaries of all ſorts, (which the Colledge <hi>de propagande ſide,</hi> as they call it doth maintain) to foment theſe our diviſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, in hope that thereby we ſhall be made a prey unto them at laſt. Now to take this advantage out of their hands, and to ſtop the gaps whereby they break in upon us, that they may cunningly heighten our paſſions, and make our diviſions irreconcilible; there is no likely way but this, that ſome Godly and conſiderate Party ſhould ſtir up the reſt to correſpond with it ſelf, and each with another, in theſe main and fundamental Duties &amp; Truths of Chriſtianity, wherein they are all united, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have all attained, notwithſtanding their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions in leſſer matters. And except ſome ſuch courſe be taken, there is no humane poſſibility to prevent the effect of the plots which the Papall Conclave hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches, which it hath proſcated and doth proſecute with indefatigable diligence, with innumerable Agents of ſeveral ſorts, with immenſe coſt and charge, with all manner of crafty inſinuations, and fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with all the zeal that either the opinion of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heaven, or the hope of temporal Greatneſs, Power, and Profit can breed in Superſtitious, in Ambitions, and in Covetous minds. Therefore to countermine theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the common Adverſaries, and to cut them ſhort of the advantages, by which they will at laſt work out their ends, if no remedy be found: this religious Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency in things whereunto the Churches have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is abſolutely neceſſary; and without ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between them to this effect, it will be impoſſible, as to men to prevent the miſchief which will enſue.</p>

               <p>AS for the Proteſtant ſtates in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſewhere through out <hi>Europe;</hi> if we look upon the cauſes of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42327:5"/>
their weakening and unſettlement hitherto, we may eaſily read their deſtiny in time to come, if theſe Cauſes bee not ſpeedily removed. For it is certain that the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> and the Papall Conclave, ſince the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the V. When the firſt warre about Religion was raiſed, in the year 1546 have entered into a League for the Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Proteſtant Party, which hath been to this day maintained between them and the Deſign thereof conſtantly proſecuted; nor hath any thing both firſt and laſt given them the advantages of all their ſucceſſes, ſo much as the divided affections and neglected Intereſts of Proteſtants amongſt themſelves, about matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> in this laſt war, did betray and deſert firſt the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> in his undertaking, and made him miſcarry in the defence of the Proteſtant Cauſe, onely becauſe he was jealous; that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (as they are called) ſhould become too great in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And then afterward he refuſed to joyn in the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Evangelical Confederacie erected at <hi>Heilbmar,</hi> in the year 1633. onely becauſe he would not be engaged to maintain a War for the ſecuring of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, joyntly with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which the <hi>Suediſh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to do: and although at the pacification of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> in the year 1648. the <hi>Suedes</hi> have carried it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Rights of both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, ſhall be equally ſecured and upheld in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire; yet it is manifeſt, that not onely the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ever ſince hath perſecuted the Proteſtants more then ever before in his Hereditary Lands, and that at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dyet of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> nothing hath been ratified which was concluded at <hi>Munſter,</hi> to the advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe; but the whole matter of that Treatie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereunto hath rather been made Diſputable, and is hitherto without effect, and will henceforth be made void; becauſe he <hi>Pope</hi> having declared that whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prejudicial to the Church, and conſequently null: the zealous Papiſt is bound not to keep it, though ſworn to it, ſeeing he hath diſpenced with his Oath, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42327:5"/>
the publique good of the Church. Thus although the <hi>Suedes</hi> did conſtrain the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to a peace with the Proteſtant Party; yet they will but watch for their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to break it with advantage as ſoon as they can, ſo that it is is very manifeſt, that the Emperor having gotten his ends at this Dyet, to have his Son made King of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> doth ſtill proſecute his deſign to bring the Proteſtant States under his and the <hi>Popes</hi> ſubjection, and to make himſelf abſolute in the Empire: nor is there any humane poſſibility to prevent the future prevalency of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> abſoluteneſs, and the effect of the Papall league therewith for the extirpation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Party, but by removing the cauſes of that weakening and unſettlement which hath hitherto befallen unto them, which are none other but their want of concurrence and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Correſpondency in a common intereſt for common ſafety and Goſpel liberty. If therefore this concurrence, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency in religious matters, which is to be the true ground thereof, cannot be procured nor maintained amongſt Proteſtants; it is apparent that the Cauſe wil be loſt, and that henceforth without a miracle (which we have no ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to hope for in this caſe,) no ſafety can be hoped for to ſecure and preſerve the Proteſtant States in <hi>Europe:</hi> ſeeing they are not onely in <hi>Germany,</hi> but out of <hi>Germany</hi> alſo; not only divided and ſhattered in their Counſels without any Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency for a common aime, but even falling out one with another, and fiercely breaking one anothers ſtrength; which Diviſions the enemies ſeek with induſtry to foment, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant between Us, and the United Provinces.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſuch as can fore-ſee this eminent danger (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is rational cannot but fore-ſee it) and ſuch as can diſcern the onely remedy thereof to be ſuch a religious Corerſpondency as is here ſued for; and yet are not willing to ſet this remedy a work for common ſafety: it is evident that ſuch are not onely unfaithfull to the cauſe of Religion, but in their heart Deſerters and Betrayers of the common intereſt of Proteſtants, which God certainly will call them to an acconut for, if he hath betruſted them with means fit to uphold the ſame for his truths ſake: for God doth give a Banner to his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42327:6"/>
people for his truths ſake; and to whom the Banner is given, they are bound to diſplay it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. 4. but how to diſplay it without ſome religious Correſpondence towards a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the work of common ediſication, is not imaginable; and therefore ſuch a Correſpondency is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
               <p>If the diſadvantages which Proteſtants lie under at this time for want of a mutual Concurrence in their common intereſt, ſhould be reckoned up in particular, this Diſcourſe might be inlarged unto a great Volum, but this is not ſutable to my ſcope, and needleſs at this time; it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that whereas heretofore in the Empire, the Voyces in the Electoral Colledge were equall, <hi>viz</hi> three Proteſtants, and three Papiſts; and the War was raiſed for the caſting Voyce, namely that of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> whether the Proteſtant or the Papiſt ſhould have it: now it is apparant that the iſſue is not onely a determination of that Voyce, to be Hereditari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annexed unto the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but that in the other Voyces of that Colledge, the Papiſts have gotten Four for Three, ſo that in the Supreme Sphere of the Empire, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Party is wholly weakened; and if (as there is cauſe to ſuſpect)tl at the eldeſt Prince of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Electoral Houſe, wil turn Papiſt, then it is likely the Five Papiſts will caſt out the Two remaining Proteſtants, <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Palatin,</hi> which are ſo weak already that they can make no defence, if any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault ſhould be made againſt them.</p>
               <p>As for the other diſadvantages both within and without the Empire, there is ſcarce any great Proteſtant Family, but the Papall induſtrie hath gotten ſome branch of it to graft it upon the old Stock; by which meanes all manner of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are prepared to divide and break them within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: as formerly the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the V. brake the <hi>Saxou</hi> Family by ſetting <hi>Maurice</hi> againſt <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> all the places of Security which the Proteſtants had, are taken from them; and that which in former time the Romane French Church rejected as a prejudice unto their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is now received and admitted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which the Papall Conclave, and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have made a yoke to be impoſed upon the necks of all States
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42327:6"/>
throughout <hi>Europe:</hi> and who ever will not ſubmit unto it, is to be cut off. Thus both in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> the Deſign of ſuppreſſing the Proteſtant Profeſſion, is ſtrongly carryed on; and there wil be no poſſibility to hinder it in humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but all appearance to haſten it, if there can be no Religious Correſpondence ſet a foot amongſt the heads of the Proteſtants to concur in thoughts which ſhould advance the Goſpel, and ſettle the grounds of common fafety for their mutual preſervation. Such then as are betruſted with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique management of the affairs of Proteſtants, and make it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not any part of their work to advance a Religious Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency to this effect amongſt them, when they have the Means in their hand, and ability and opportunity to do it, will have much to anſwer before God. Therefore ſuch a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency is abſolutely neceſſary to be intended and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; not onely for the advancement of the Truth of the Goſpel, in ſerving Chriſt with one ſhoulder againſt Antichriſt; but in reſpect of outward ſafety, and the ſecuring of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and Spirituall Rights and Liberties, to our ſelves, to our Brethren, and to our Poſterity.</p>

               <p>NOw if it hath been Convincingly made out both upon Spiritual and Rational grounds, that for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Kingdom in the world, and for the outward ſafety and Preſervation of the Churches, a Religious Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency is abſolutly neceſſary unto them; then an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may further, and ought alſo to be made of two things. Firſt, to whom chiefly the procurement of this Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency doth belong. Secondly, How it may be procured and obtained amongſt the Churches? And to anſwer theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I conceive we may ſay thus firſt in the Generall.</p>
               <p>That the procurement of this Correſpondency, doth chiefly belong to thoſe who ſtand moſt in need thereof for their own welfare and ſafety, and who have moſt eminently engaged themſelves to undertake the procurement of it. And that the way to procure it amongſt the Churches, can be none other but a Chriſtian endeavour to live and converſe with other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42327:7"/>
Profeſſors in the communion of Saints, which is not to look to our own things alone, but that every one ſhould look alſo to the things of others; and in the conſideration of others, to<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil. 2.4. Heb.</hi> 10.24</note> provoke them unto love, and to good works.</p>
               <p>This much in Generall: but then to Anſwer the firſt Query in particular; I conceive it may be truly ſaid;</p>
               <p>That the Godly Party living in this Common-wealth, doth ſtand in more need of this Correſpondency for the welfare of their Cauſe, and for their own ſafety, then any other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do; and that this ſame Party, hath more eminently En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged it ſelf towards God and Men, to undertake the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Correſpondency, then any other Churches have done. And to make out both theſe Aſſertions to be truths, I ſhall briefly offer theſe Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt in reſpect of the need which they ſtand of it; it is in my apprehenſion thus.</p>
               <p>The Godly Party of this Nation hath been led forth in a peculiar way of acting againſt the world, and againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which others have not been acquainted withall.</p>
               <p>This acting hath ſet them in oppoſition, not only to the world and Antichriſt, in a more direct way then others, but alſo put them at a diſtance from their Brethren themſelves; who partly by reaſon of their weakneſs, partly for want of that information which we ſhould have given them; partly becauſe they have been prepoſſeſſed with falſe and injurious Informations againſt us, are for the moſt part ſo offended at us, that they ſcruple to own us as Brethren, and look upon us rather as Apoſtates from the Cauſe, and cut of from all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards other Proteſtants; in their eſteem we are a new thing, ſtart up and ſtanding alone by our ſelves. Now to be in ſuch a condition, ſeemes to be for us very unſafe; for if our Enemies be able without any controule, to repreſent us unto the world, and to the Profeſſors of the Goſpell, as Monſters of Men; and if we take no thought how to vindicate our Cauſe from falſe aſperſions towards our Brethren, and towards Men of impartial judgement; the Cauſe of Chriſtian and civill Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberty which we have undertaken and maintained hitherto, cannot proſper, but muſt needs at laſt miſcarry in our hands.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42327:7"/>
For the proſperity of the Cauſe, is nothing elſe but the gaining of Godly Mens Affections at home and abroad to it: and if we make no Appilcation to our Godly Brethren and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to ſet them right, and inform them of the truth of our Cauſe and Proceedings, and to intereſt them to Correſpond with us upon a Goſpel account; how can our Proceedings be ſucceſſeful? how can our Cauſe be juſtified? and how can we promiſe ſafety to our ſelves, when our profeſſed Enemies, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our miſled Neighbours, ſhall joyntly conſpire and riſe up againſt us? I know, and am confident that the Cauſe will proſper in Gods hand, and that he will carry it on, and preſerve the Inſtruments thereof, who follow him in his way; but I do not ſee any ground to believe that he wil do it without the ordinary Goſpel Means of propagating the Truth, and of maintaining the Communion of Saints. If then he doth intend to preſerve us, and to make uſe of us any further in this his work; I am very confident that he wil ſet us in the way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he hath promiſed to give a bleſſing, which is the way of Brotherly love; in a Religious Correſpondency towards the reſt of the Churches profeſſing his Name in the Truth. By how much then our undertakings are more reſolute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the courſe of the world, by ſo much they are the more difficult to be carried on; &amp; therefore we ſtand the more in need of the help and concurrence of the Godly, every where to carry it on with us to a good iſſue. And by how much our preſent Leaders in the Cauſe are leſs intereſſed in the Godly Party abroad; by ſo much if they deſire to provide in Gods way for the ſucceſs of the Cauſe, and for their own ſafety therein: they ſhould the more apply themſelves to advance a Goſpel-intereſt towards all the Profeſſors thereof; and maintain with them to this effect, a Religious Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy therein. For as a man that is in a fight, doth not make uſe of any one of his members alone; but all the members of his body are ſet in a poſture to concur, &amp; ſupply mutual ſtrength as ſtanding in need of each others help: ſo in this conflict of the Body of Chriſt againſt the Powers of the World, and the ſubtilty of Antichriſt; as all the Churches are aimed at and aſſaulted, ſo they ſtand in need of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42327:8"/>
help; and that part of the body which is moſt violently aſſaulted, ſtandeth moſt in need of the aſſiſtance of the reſt for its ſafety. Now it is without all doubt, that the Godly Party of this Nation, is moſt in the eye of the Enemie; and when the Univerſal breach (which is near at hand) between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts ſhall be made, it will be moſt violently put at; therefore it doth ſtand moſt in need of help, and is bound for its own ſafety in a Goſpel way to endeavour to receive it.</p>
               <p>But the matter of Danger wherein we are more then others, is not the onely reaſon which doth oblige us to procure this Correſpondency more then others; but the Engagement which lies upon the Godly Party of this Nation more eminently then upon others to procure it, is another obligation bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us thereunto.</p>
               <p>This Engagement is eminently apparant in three Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the State.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdome, publiſhed by the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the National League and Covenant of both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, In the Declaration of this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, publiſhed the 12th. of <hi>July,</hi> this year 1653.</p>
               <p>In the Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdome, at the latter end thereof, the Clauſe obliging the Godly Party which then did manage Publique Affairs, to mind a Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie towards for raign Proteſtants, is expreſſed in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We will labour by all offices of Friendſhip, to unite the Forraign Churches with us in the ſame Cauſe; and to ſeeke their Libertie, Safety, and Proſperity, as bound therunto by Charity to them, and by wiſdome for our own good: for by this means our own ſtrength ſhall be increaſed, and by a mutuall concurrence to the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon End, we ſhall be able to procure the good of the whole body of the Proteſtant Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is as ſolemne a Promiſe, fully and expreſly obliging them to ſeek this Concurrence and Correſpondency, as can in ſo few words be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>In the National League and Covenant, the laſt words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of engage alſo deeply thoſe that did ſwear it, to deſire affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42327:8"/>
as in the preſence of God, and conſequently when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhould be to endeavour ſincerely this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſucceſs of our proceedings, may be deliverance and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all Gods people, and an encouragement to other Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches groaning under, and in danger of the yoake of Antichriſtian Tyrannie, to oyn with us in the ſame or like Aſſociation and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Glory of God, the enlargement of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the peace and Tranquility of Chriſtian Kingdomes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This profeſſion being made in preſence of God, with a hand lifted up unto Heaven by the Godly Party of both Nations, as it is conſcionably to be minded; ſo it cannot reach the End for which it was made, to give an encouragement to other Chriſtian Churches, to aſſert joyntly with us their Goſpel Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, except we endeavour to maintain a Religious Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with them.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42327:9"/>
with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now where ſuch profeſſions are ſo ſolemnly and ſo largely in a publique way addreſſed unto God, and all his people in this and in Neighbour Nations, and made in a manner the chief matter which is aimed at in this preſent Parliament; what can be conceived more obliging towards the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the work? If therefore we ſhould put forth no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perform this Duty, whereof we acknowledge our ſelves ſo fully convicted, by ſo many Profeſſions, and Vowes, and Prayers, and Declarations; will it not be a guilt lying ſo much the heavier upon us in the day of our accounts, by how much the more we have engaged our ſelves unto it. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God will not be mocked; and if after ſo many Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in times of diſtreſſe, and Deliverances ſince obtained, and Succeſſes given in to inable us to perform our Vowes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; we ſhould undertake nothing towards the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Duty, which lyeth ſo eminently upon us, our guilt will ſuddenly overtake us, and the puniſhment thereof, if not prevented by ſome attempts ſutable to our Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will be fearful and ſevere.</p>
               <p>Therefore that it may be prevented, the ſecond Querie ſhould be laid to heart; <hi>viz. How a Religious Correſpondency may be procured and maintained between the Godly Party of this Nation, and the Forraign Proteſtant Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to anſwer this Querie, it is not my ſcope at this time, I onely do intend to ſhew the neceſſity of laying it to heart, by thoſe who ſhall think themſelves concerned in finding ſome reſolution thereunto; and as it ſhall pleaſe God to move their hearts and open their inclinations, to ſet forward in their way this Deſign: if they will acquaint me therewith, I ſhall not conceal my thoughts from them, which I ſhall conceive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible unto this End and Purpoſe, which herewith I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the providence of God, and the prayers of Godly Souls; and having diſcharged my Conſcience for mine own part thus far in this matter, I ſhall wait for the hand of God to lead thoſe that love him further, and remaine for Sions ſake, as in all theſe troubles I have been all along without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality according to my ability,</p>
